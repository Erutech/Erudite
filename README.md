# Erudite
Erudite Project Repo for Rowdy Hacks SP2021

About the Project

By definition, Erudite means "having or showing great knowledge or learning." We made Erudite to incentivize student courseload with gamification inspired by monster raising games that create a connection between the player and charming, magical creatures.

As students ourselves, we believe that the instant gratification rewarded by something like Erudite can help students stay on track with school and make the process a little more fun.

What it does

Erudite connects to a student's Blackboard account\* to monitor assignment grades. Students are rewarded _Erudite_ based on their performance on assignments. The higher the grade, the more Erudite! Erudite is used to level up _Eruditechi_, magical study pals in the app. 

As Eruditechi gain EXP through Erudite and level up over time, the Eruditechi go through different stages of evolution! Users can see their Eruditechi on the main page of the app and watch them grow.
